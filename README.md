# facedetect
Tested OpenCV in Python for Bitcamp '15. Code works as it is. Include different Haarcascade files to detect different features.

Overlay any face in a camera stream with `img{#}.jpg`. Replace `img{#}.jpg` with a image of your choice.

We rewrote the code in Javascript for Bitcamp '15 submission. Completed project could be found (here)[https://github.com/chelseavalentine/Stardazed].
